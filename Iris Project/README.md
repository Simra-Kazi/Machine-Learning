# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project is a **machine learning classification model** that predicts the species of an **Iris flower** based on its features. The model is integrated into a **Streamlit web application** for user-friendly interaction.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:  
- **Sepal Length (cm)**  
- **Sepal Width (cm)**  
- **Petal Length (cm)**  
- **Petal Width (cm)**  
- **Target (Iris Species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)**  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Preprocessing)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **Streamlit** (Web App)  

## Model Details  
The classification model is trained using different algorithms, including:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

## Installation  
To run this project locally, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone
2. Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py
## Usage
Open the Streamlit web app.
Enter the flower measurements (sepal and petal dimensions).
Click Predict to get the result.
The app will display the predicted Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).
## Results & Performance
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% (based on evaluation).
Confusion matrix, classification report, and visualization plots are available for analysis.
## Future Improvements
Improve model accuracy with advanced techniques.
Deploy the app on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS.
Implement real-time image-based classification.
